This program serves as the project for group 7 in IST 412. This is an application that can be used as a vacation planner for the fictional WallyLand Vacation Group (WLVG). 

The idea was to create an application where vacationers can plan their trip prior to visiting, as well as manage their reservations and plans while in the park. 
This includes purchasing tickets, reserving ride times, food reservations and/or ordering food, and much more. The 4 use cases we focused on were planning the trip,
ordering food, booking ride times, and login/notifications.

The planning use case involves selecting what days that the guest would like to buy tickets for and how many. They have the ability to go back in and cancel their purchase as well.
When a guest goes to order food on the app, they have several abilities on the interface. They can view the menu of available options at the restaurants in the park, then head
to the checkout where they select the amounts of food that are requested. This is put into the cart, that displays the total and the customer can pay. For booking rides, they can view openings for ride times and book the number of tickets and guests who will be going 
on the ride at this time. This gives them a mobile ticket, that when they arrive at the ride queue at the specific time they use to show the ride attendant to let them in the line.
For login and account settings, they have the ability so sign up with email address and input a password.

This application gives visitors and lovers of WallyLand Vacation Group to easily plan their trip to the park and customize it to their liking in order to enjoy their time and
not stress about waiting in lines or not being able to access the resources and opportunities that WallyLand has to offer!
